\section{Introduction}
Blockchain technology ignited a vision of a decentralized future, yet its promise stumbles against a persistent barrier: scalability. As humanity colonizes the stars, artificial intelligence redefines economies, and edge computing demands instant responsiveness, traditional blockchains—bound by linear ledgers—buckle under exponential transaction volumes. Blocktree emerges as a paradigm shift, replacing rigid chains with a dynamically growing tree architecture that scales without bounds. Inspired by \href{https://x.com/IbaiBasabe}{@IbaiBasabe}’s vision for infinite scalability and \href{https://x.com/billqian_uae}{@billqian\_uae}’s FinTech 6.0 framework, Blocktree leverages subsecond block times and topology-aware clustering to empower autonomous AI agents, real-time edge applications, and interstellar commerce. Its branches, split periodically using the Fiedler vector of a latency-based Laplacian matrix~\cite{ng2001spectral}, form a network that adapts to planetary distances and beyond, unified by a shared cryptocurrency, Blocktree Coin (BKT). This white paper unveils how Blocktree transcends today’s blockchain limitations, offering a scalable, permissionless foundation for machine economies on Earth, financial systems on Mars, and decentralized networks across the cosmos. We explore the challenges of current blockchains, present Blocktree’s innovative solution, detail its technical architecture, and illustrate its transformative potential through practical use cases.
