Blocktree redefines blockchain scalability to power the next era of decentralized systems, from artificial intelligence and edge computing to interstellar economies. Departing from linear ledgers, Blocktree introduces a dynamically growing tree architecture that splits branches periodically using the Fiedler vector of a latency-based Laplacian matrix~\cite{ng2001spectral}, achieving unparalleled throughput with subsecond block times. Unified by Blocktree Coin (BKT), a cryptocurrency mined across branches, this permissionless network supports autonomous AI-driven finance, real-time edge DApps, and delay-tolerant space transactions. This white paper explores the limitations of traditional blockchains, presents Blocktree’s innovative solution, and details its technical foundation, key features, and transformative use cases—such as Martian commerce and IoT networks. Through open-source collaboration, Blocktree aims to forge a trustless, scalable platform that spans Earth, Mars, and beyond, inviting innovators to join in building a decentralized cosmic future.
