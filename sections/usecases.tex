\section{Use Cases}
\subsection{Space Economies}
Blocktree enables robust financial systems for interstellar commerce, such as a Martian colony exchanging goods with Earth-based suppliers through BKT transactions. Miners on Mars operate within a localized branch, leveraging subsecond block times for rapid validation, while branch autonomy ensures reliability despite communication delays of up to 24 minutes. For example, asteroid mining operations could log resource claims on a branch’s ledger, with periodic splits via the Fiedler vector ensuring scalability as settlements grow across the solar system.

\subsection{AI Economies}
Blocktree powers autonomous AI-driven economies by allowing agents to manage decentralized finance (DeFi) operations, such as algorithmic trading or liquidity provision, directly on-chain. With thousands of transactions per second per branch, AI agents can execute strategies in real-time, unhindered by human oversight. A network of AI traders could optimize portfolios across branches, with topology-aware clustering minimizing latency for Earth-based nodes, fostering a self-sustaining machine economy.

\subsection{Edge DApps}
Blocktree supports low-latency decentralized applications (DApps) critical for edge computing scenarios, such as smart city IoT networks or immersive gaming platforms. Subsecond block times enable near-instant data processing—for example, a traffic system adjusting signals in milliseconds based on sensor inputs. The Fiedler vector partitions nodes into proximity-based clusters, ensuring DApps on a branch validate transactions with minimal delay, ideal for real-time interactions across distributed devices.
